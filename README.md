- Firebase Authentication with Email/Password, Google Sign In, Facebook Sign In, GitHub Sign In, and Email Sign In available to authenticate users.
- The emails registered in Firebase Authentication are saved in a separate database for future data development of individual users, for this illustration Firestore Database.
- Session data is encrypted in local storage.
